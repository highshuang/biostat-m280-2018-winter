Our Apache Yarn cluster hosts the [flights](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) data representing 123 million flights over 22 years. Read the [lecture notes](http://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2018winter/slides/12-sparklyr/sparklyr-flights.html) on how to access the Yarn cluster. Connect to the database using `sparklyr` and answer following questions. You can base your answers on a specific year or the whole data set.

Sys.setenv(SPARK_HOME="/usr/lib/spark")

1. Map the top 10 busiest airports. Size of dots should reflect the number of flights through that destination.  
Hint: You may find this tutorial on [Making Maps in R](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html) helpful.

```{r}
# destinations with corresponding number of flights
dest <- flight_2008 %>% filter(!is.na(dest)) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(n_dest = count()) %>%
  select(dest, n_dest)

# origin with corresponding number of flights
origin <- flight_2008 %>% filter(!is.na(origin)) %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarize(n_ori = count()) %>%
  select(origin, n_ori)

# left join to get number of flights fly in and out the same airport
# show only first top 10 busy airport
busyair <- left_join(dest, origin, by = c("dest" = "origin")) %>%
  transmute(
    airport = dest,
    numFlight = n_dest + n_ori
  ) %>% arrange(desc(numFlight)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  head(10)

# get airport location info for first 10 busy airport 
busyair_loc <- airports %>% filter(faa %in% busyair$airport) %>%
  collect()

# combine top 10 airport with their location info
busy <- left_join(busyair, busyair_loc, by = c("airport" = "faa"))

# convert latitude and longitude to numeric values
busy_numeric <- busy %>% 
  transmute(airport = airport, 
            numFlight = numFlight,
            lat = as.numeric(lat),
            lon = as.numeric(lon),
            name = name)
  
# draw data on map
# get usa map info    
usa <- get_map(location = 'united states', zoom = 4)

# print airport with dot size according to the numFlight
ggmap(usa) + 
  geom_point(data = busy, aes(x = as.numeric(lon), y = as.numeric(lat), 
                              size = numFlight), alpha = 0.7, 
             color = "yellow") +
  labs(x = "Longitude", 
       y = "Latitude", 
       title = "Top 10 Busiest Airports in 2008",
       subtitle = "Based on number of flights fly in and out") +
  coord_fixed(0.8) +
  geom_label_repel(data = busy, label = busy$airport, 
                   aes(x = as.numeric(lon), y = as.numeric(lat)), size = 3)
  
```

* The top 10 busiest airports are determined by the number of flights fly in and fly out the airport. The above graph is generated based on data from year 2008 in the U.S. The size of the yellow dot is proportional to the number of flights through the airport. The label shows that in 2008, SFO, LAX, LAS, PHX, DEN, DFW, IAH, ATL, DTW and ORD are the top busiest airports in the U.S.

2. Map the top 10 busiest direct routes. Size of lines should reflect the number of flights through that route.

```{r}
# get top 10 busiest direct routes
busyRoute <- flights_tbl %>% filter(year == 2000, origin != "Origin") %>%
  filter(!is.na(origin), !is.na(dest)) %>%
  group_by(origin, dest) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  head(10)

# get the origin info 
ori_loc <- airports %>%
  filter(faa %in% busyRoute$origin) %>% 
  transmute(
    ori_lat = as.numeric(lat),
    ori_lon = as.numeric(lon),
    ori_faa = faa, 
    ori_name = name
  ) %>%
  collect()

ori_loc <- left_join(ori_loc, busyRoute, by = c("ori_faa" = "origin")) %>%
  select(ori_lat, ori_lon, ori_faa, ori_name, dest, n)

# get the destination info 
dest_loc <- airports %>%
  filter(faa %in% busyRoute$dest) %>%
  transmute(
    dest_lat = as.numeric(lat),
    dest_lon = as.numeric(lon),
    dest_faa = faa,
    dest_name = name
  ) %>%
  collect()

# combine both origin and dest locaction info 
# add line size scale (exponent = 6 enlarge the difference)
busyRoute_loc <- left_join(ori_loc, dest_loc, by = c("dest" = "dest_faa")) %>%
  mutate(line_scale = (n/max(n))^8)

## subset for unique airports
# get origin airports info 
ori_airport <- busyRoute_loc %>% 
  transmute(
    airport = ori_faa,
    lon = ori_lon,
    lat = ori_lat) 

# get destination airports info
dest_airport <- busyRoute_loc %>%
  transmute(
    airport = dest,
    lon = dest_lon,
    lat = dest_lat) 

# combine dest and ori airports and find unique airports
uniq_airport <- bind_rows(ori_airport, dest_airport) %>%
  distinct(airport, .keep_all = TRUE)

# print airport with dot size according to the numFlight
states <- map_data("state")
route_plot <- ggplot(data = states) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = region, group = group), 
               color = "white") + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  guides(fill=FALSE)

route_plot + 
  geom_point(data = uniq_airport, aes(x = uniq_airport$lon, y = uniq_airport$lat),
             size = 3, color = "goldenrod1") +
  geom_label_repel(data =  uniq_airport, aes(x = lon, y = lat), 
                   label =  uniq_airport$airport, size = 3) +
  labs(x = "Longitude", 
       y = "Latitude", 
       title = "Top 10 Busiest Direct Routes in 2000") +
  geom_curve(data = busyRoute_loc, aes(x = ori_lon, y = ori_lat, 
                                       xend = dest_lon, yend = dest_lat),
             arrow = arrow(angle = 15, ends = "first", 
                           length = unit(0.18, "cm"), type = "closed"), 
             size = busyRoute_loc$line_scale, alpha = 0.7, color = "darkblue",
             curvature = 0.1, inherit.aes = TRUE) +
  coord_fixed(1.3)
  
```

* The top 10 busiest direct routes in the U.S. air are calculated by summarizing top 10 routes with the most number of flights in 2000. The above graph shows the 10 

3. LAX:

    ![](./lax-by-day-98-08.png)
    </p>

    (a). Reproduce above plot. Visualize and explain some prominent features you observe. For example, what happened at points 1-5?
    
```{r}
air_LAX <- flights_tbl %>%
  filter(origin == "LAX" | dest == "LAX") %>%
  filter(year <= 2008, year >= 1998) %>%
  select(year, month, dayofmonth, origin, dest) %>%
  group_by(year, month, dayofmonth) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>% collect()

date <- air_LAX %>% 
  transmute(
    date = make_date(year = year, month = month, day = dayofmonth)
  )

# create 5 labels for the turning points
dates <- c("2001-09-11", "2004-11-01", "2004-06-01", "2008-01-01", 
           "2001-01-01")
n <- c(1100, 900, 950, 1200, 1200)
num_lab <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5")
labels <- data.frame(num_lab, dates, n)
    
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = air_LAX, aes(x = date, y = n)) +
  labs(title = "LAX air traffic") +
  geom_label(data = labels, aes(x = as.Date(dates, "%Y-%m-%d"), y = n, 
                                label = num), 
             size = 6) +
  coord_fixed(2.3) + theme_bw()
  
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = air_LAX, aes(x = date$date, y = n)) +
  labs(
    x = "date",
    y = "n",
    title = "LAX air traffic")

```


    (b). Visualize and explain seasonal effects.
  
    (c). Visualize and explain weekly effects.
  
    (d). Map top 10 destinations from LAX. Size of dots should reflect the number of flights from LAX to that destination.
    
4. Build a predictive model for the arrival delay (`arrdelay`) of flights flying from LAX. Use the same filtering criteria as in the [lecture notes](http://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2018winter/slides/12-sparklyr/sparklyr-flights.html) to construct training and validation sets. You are allowed to use a maximum of 5 predictors. The prediction performance of your model on the validation data set will be an important factor for grading this question.
    
5. Visualize and explain any other information you want to explore.
